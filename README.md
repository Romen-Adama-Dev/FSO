# FSO Repository

This repository is created for uploading the projects and assignments that I will be working on throughout the year for the course "Fundamentals of Operating Systems". The course involves working in the terminal and completing projects in the C language.

## Folder Structure

- The `Practicas` folder contains all the assignments that are given throughout the year.
- The `Proyectos Finalizados` folder contains all the projects that are to be completed in the course.
- The `Recursos` folder contains all the necessary resources such as reference materials, books, and links to online resources that will be used in the course.
- The `Script` An automated script is a set of predefined instructions that are executed automatically when triggered. In the context of a GitHub repository, an automated script can be used to update the repository without manual intervention.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

Once the repository is cloned, you can start working on the assignments or projects by navigating to the respective folders in the terminal.
